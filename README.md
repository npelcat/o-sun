Creation of a site for a self-employed woman.

Showcase site for services, contact form and call-to-action for booking one or more services.

Currently functional on the site:
- Home Page (index.tsx at the root of the Pages folder)
- Routes to different pages
- Contact form


Projects for the future :
- Google reviews integrated
- Possibility of booking services directly on the site
- Possibility of logging in (management of customer accounts with Database)
- Ability to pay via the site directly and view orders


### This site is currently the project that I will present for my Developer diploma with Ada Tech School. 
### All kind and constructive advice is welcome! THANKS :)
